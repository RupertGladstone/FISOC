This folder should contain recipes or definition files for containers that are of use to FISOC users or developers.  FS is short for FISOC Singularity.

The images themselves are too big to store in this git repository.
TODO: place the images somewhere accessible online, perhaps in the sylabs library?

FS_post.def - contains a python installation with vtk and paraview modules included, so that python scripts to process vtu files (as produced by Elmer) can be easily run.

Example command to build an image from a singularity definition file:
sudo singularity build FC_proc.sif FC_proc.def

Singularity documentation can be found here:
