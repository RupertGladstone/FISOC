This folder should contain recipes or definition files for containers that are of use to FISOC users or developers.  FS is short for FISOC Singularity.

The images themselves are too big to store in this git repository.
TODO: place the images somewhere accessible online, perhaps in the sylabs library?

FS_post.def - contains a python installation with vtk and paraview modules included, so that python scripts to process vtu files (as produced by Elmer) can be easily run.

Example command to build an image from a singularity definition file (this takes some time, of the order of an hour or so):
sudo singularity build FC_proc.sif FC_proc.def

Example command to launch a container in which important host directories (containing FISOC output files and postprocessing scripts) are bound to the container:
singularity shell --bind /media/sf_VBshare/FISOC_Ex5_bil2:/files,/home/gladstone/Source/FISOC/FISOC_pp/:/scripts FS_post.sif/
singularity shell --bind /host/path/to/output/files:/files,/host/path/to/FISOC/clone/FISOC_pp/:/scripts FS_post.sif/

The above command launches an interactive shell.  FISOC postprocessing scripts can then be run at the command line.  For example, to create a text file containing a time series of grounded area from Elmer:
python /scripts/ElmerGroundedArea.py
