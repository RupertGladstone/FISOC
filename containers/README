This folder should contain recipes or definition files for images that are of use to FISOC users or developers.  FS is short for FISOC Singularity.

TODO: place the images somewhere accessible online, perhaps in the sylabs library?

The images themselves are too big to store in this git repository.

FS_post.def - contains a python installation with vtk and paraview modules included, so that python scripts to process vtu files (as produced by Elmer) can be easily run.
