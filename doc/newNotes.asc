*** review variable names, get input from co-authors.

*** Add something about containers
mention that this is just an example for now, just a postprocessing sif (singularity image file) with
some python/paraview packages.

*** review/remove all README files from repository, move contents to manual.

*** Add some notes on post processing

*** Some things to add to the manual re coding practices/software design.

requirements in terms of config info.  special rules, e.g. ts_ratio divisible by OM_output etc

notes on derived attributes for setting defaults

software design sections include:

overall structure
relationship between FISOC code structure and ESMF objects:
state objects used doen to FISOC OM/ISM level, but not in model specific wrappers.
model specific wrappers use fieldbundles as highest level objects.

something on use of alarms.

error handling:
uses ESMF methods for error handlling, but currently all errors within the FISOC code cause the error to be
logged and the program to terminate via ESMF_finalize.
If the FISOC code structures become more complex this could easily be extended to intead return the error
up through the FISOC part of the call stack, for more complete 
traceability.
In either case, errors are generally considered fatal.



parallelisation and domain decomposition:
VM, PET, MPI
sequential, duplicate mpi comm for components that need it.
