FISOC required fields
=====================

Abbreviations for levels:
l0                 level 0 is the base of the ice (i.e. the height of the ice-ocean interface)
l1                 level 1 is the first ISM model level above the base of the ice

Variable naming convention: always start with component abbreviation (OM or ISM). 
Follow by meaningful name, followed by level indicator.

ISM fields:
ISM_temperature_l0 Ice temperature at level 0
ISM_temperature_l1 Ice temperature at level 1
ISM_z_l0           Height above sea level at level 0
ISM_z_l1           Height above sea level at level 1
ISM_dTdz_l0        Rate of change of temperature with height above sea level at level 0
ISM_z_l0_previous  Height above sea level at level 0, previous timestep

OM fields:
OM_dBdt_l0         Rate of change of height (above sea level) of ice base at level 0 (note: B = z_l0)

FISOC doesn't care about units.  The user must ensure consistency.  These should work ok with Elmer/Ice 
standard set up:
Centigrade (C), metres (m), C/m, m/year.  Timesteps typically in years in Elmer/Ice.  Typically seconds 
in FISOC.  Care required.
