FISOC User Guide

Framework for Ice Sheet - Ocean Coupling

Pre-requisites:
ESMF must be installed with netcdf.  Compiling netcdf to give the right libraries for ESMF can be 
fiddly.  As of early 2014 the notes in FISOC_ESMF_CompileNotes.asc were relevant.

An Ice Sheet Model (ISM) must be available.  Alternatively, the FISOC framework can be 
tested using the dummy ISM provided.

An Ocean Model (OM) must be available.  Alternatively, the FISOC framework can be 
tested using the dummy OM provided.

Note that the dummy models do not provide any physically meaningful outputs.

***something on developing: required structures within FISOC_ISM_XXX.f90 and the OM equivalent.

Building and running FISOC
==============
Simply run make in the top level FISOC directory.

In order to use an ISM called ISM_name, you need to set the environment variable FISOC_ISM.  
If you use bash you can do this by adding the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:
export FISOC_ISM="dummy"

In order to use an OM called OM_name, you need to set the environment variable FISOC_OM.
If you use bash you can do this by adding the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:
export FISOC_OM="dummy"

Do not directly modify the files FISOC_ISM.f90 and FISOC_OM.f90.  These are copies made 
during the build.


FISOC code structures
=====================
You need basic familiarity with the ESMF coding structures in order to understand the FISOC design.
A goood place to get started is the "getting started" document.  At time of writing (Jan 2015) this 
can be found at:
http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/users/getting_started.shtml

The FISOC hierarchy is caller -> parent -> everything else.

FISOC_caller.f90       The calling program, registers routines with ESMF
FISOC_parent.f90       ESMF gridded component, parent to ice and ocean components

Note: OM is for Ocean Model, and ISM is for Ice Sheet Model.

FISOC_coupler.f90    ESMF coupler component, handles regridding

FISOC_proc.f90       ESMF gridded component, processes temporal operations on the ice grid
FISOC_ISM.f90        ESMF gridded component, ice sheet model
FISOC_OM.f90         ESMF gridded component, ocean model


FISOC_config is a Configuration file for FISOC.  Each component (ISM and OM) may also use its own 
configuration file(s).  
Here is an example:
&config
     ts_ocn_sec = 2000,   ts_ratio = 4, 
     start_year = 2010,  start_month = 1,
     end_year = 2010,    end_month = 2, 
     tight_coupling = .TRUE./
ts_ocn_sec is the timestep of the ocean component in seconds.  ts_ratio 
is the ratio of ocean timesteps to ice sheet timesteps.  
In the example the ice sheet timestep is 8000 seconds.

Notes on extending the coupling to use different OM and ISM components:
use the dummy fortran modules (or template modules?) as a starting point.  You can add code to 
these without needing to change the soubroutine names.  Follow the ESMF guidance about making 
your component compatible with ESMF.
