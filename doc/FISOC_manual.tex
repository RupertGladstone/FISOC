\title{Framework for Ice Sheet - Ocean Coupled modelling (FISOC) Manual}

\section{Introduction}

The ``Framework for Ice Sheet - Ocean model Coupling" (FISOC) has been written to enable Ice Sheet Models 
(ISMs) and Ocean Models (OMs) to be run as a single executable to address the co-evolution of ice and ocean 
properties.  it is primarily designed to deal with the situation of a floating ice shelf at the interface 
between land ice and open ocean.

In this context an ISM simulates (part of) a marine ice sheet, including both grounded and floating parts, 
representing the dynamic evolution over time of the ice sheet.

An OM simulates the sub-shelf cavity circulation under the floating part of the ice sheet, and optionally also 
a wider ocean domain.

FISOC is a set of code modules and driver built using the Earth System Modelling Framework (ESMF, 
\url{https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/esmf/}). 
Some knowledge of the ESMF is essentially in order to fully understand the FISOC code.  It should 
be possible to run FISOC without knowledge of ESMF.

A full description of the physical processes FISOC attempts to simulate are provided in (***
ref GMD paper, not yet written).  
This manual describes how to use FISOC with an ISM and OM for which it has been 
developed (Section~\ref{sec:FISOC_SUG}) and also how to build additional ISM or OM components 
into the FISOC framework (Section~\ref{sec:FISOC_SDG}).




\section{Using FISOC with established components}
\label{sec:FISOC_SUG}

\subsection{Installing FISOC}

FISOC can be obtained by emailing a request to the author.  It is maintained and developed in a 
private GitHub repository.  We intend to make this public in 2016.

FISOC has a simple build process.  The Makefile in the top level FISOC directory contains the 
hard coded dependencies needed to build FISOC code.  The Makefile refers to certain 
environment variables to determine paths and component choices (Section~\ref{sec:EnvVars}). 

Having installed the pre-requisites (Section~\ref{sec:PreReq}), simply run at the command line, 
in the top level FISOC directory:
\begin{lstlisting}
make install
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{FISOC Environment Variables}
\label{sec:EnvVars}

Several environment variables may be used in the build process. 
Some of these are mandatory. 
These environment variables are not used at run time, only during 
the compilation/installation of FISOC.

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{FISOC\_INSTALL\_DIR}                       \\ 
Optional.                                          \\
Determines where FISOC\_caller will be installed. Defaults to \$HOME/bin. 
The user should also ensure this location is in their \$PATH. \\
\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{FISOC\_OM}                                 \\ 
Required. Possible values ``dummy'', ``ROMS''.     \\
Determines which OM component will be used.        \\
\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{FISOC\_ISM}                                \\
Required. Possible values ``dummy'', ``Elmer''.    \\
Determines which ISM component will be used.       \\
\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{FISOC\_ISM\_INC}                           \\ 
Optional.                                          \\
Full path to ISM include files.                    \\
\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{FISOC\_ISM\_SO}                            \\
Optional.                                          \\
Full path to ISM shared object library.            \\
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{Pre-requisites}
\label{sec:PreReq}

FISOC has been tested with GNU compilers on Linux Mint using OpenMPI. 

A Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation, such as 
OpenMPI (\url{http://www.open-mpi.org/}), is required. 

The Network Common Data Form (NetCDF,  
\url{http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/}) 
Fortran interface must be available 

ESMF must be available (\url{https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/esmf/}).  
ESMF should have been built with NetCDF and MPI.
For example, environment variables like these may be used for the ESMF build
(see also notes in Appendix~\ref{app:A}):
\begin{lstlisting}
export ESMF_NETCDF="split"
export ESMF_NETCDF_INCLUDE="/usr/local/include/"
export ESMF_COMM="openmpi"
\end{lstlisting}


Viable ISM and OM components must be available for any physically meaningful simulations
(the build may be tested using ``dummy'' components).  
See Sections~\ref{sec:Elmer} and \ref{sec:ROMS}.


\subsection{Running FISOC}

The FISOC executable is called FISOC\_caller, and should be located in your path after installation. 
The installation is specific to the choice of component (you need to re-compile if you switch , for 
example, from one ISM to another).  
Beyond choice of component, all other run choices are made in the FISOC\_config.rc file
(Section~\ref{sec:config}), 
or through component specific initialisation.

In the first instance a dummy coupler can be run be setting both environment variables FISOC\_ISM and 
FISOC\_OM to ``dummy'' at compile time.  This can help to test the compilation, and was used during development, 
but performs no meaningful science.  

In verbose mode (Section~\ref{sec:config}) some run time information may be printed to the screen.  
Independently of this, log files are always written, 
with default filenames of ``PET\#.FISOC.Log'', where ``\#'' is a number from 0 upwards indicating the 
``Persistent Execution Thread'' (PET). 
These logs containing run time messages and errors can be helpful with trobleshooting.
Note that FISOC appends to the logs rather than over-writing at run time, so you may wish to delete old logs 
periodically. 

Aside: PET is an ESMF abstraction designed to be general over differing parallel implementations. 
In FISOC, there is always a 1:1 relationship between PETs and MPI processes 
(Section~\ref{sec:FISOC_SDG}). 


\subsubsection{FISOC configuration}
\label{sec:config}

The FISOC config file is named FISOC\_config.rc.  This is a resource file, as described by the 
ESMF documentation.  It supports different types and also lists. 
In principle, llists of mixed types are supported, though FISOC does not utilise this utility.

FISOC\_config.rc contains code specific to the coupling.  Components may also use their 
independent means for initialisation.

Some of the FISOC config entries are required.
This section describes all the valid standard entries in a FISOC config file as follows:

\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{Timestepping}
Asynchronous timestepping.
***fill in this section we've implemented both tight coupling (ice and ocean both running 
on the same timescale) and loose coupling (for longer time scales where the ocean is run 
to steady state then the ice sheet continues until significant change has occurred in the cavity).

\subsection{Elmer/Ice}
\label{sec:Elmer}
***ref or link Elmer/Ice

FISOC needs to know where to find the relevant Elmer/Ice module files and shared object files.  
This can be done at compile time through the  *** environment variables.  
Finding the ElmerSolver.so shared object file at run time can be ensured through use of 
%the $LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable. 

For example (it is assumed \$ELMER\_HOME was set during Elmer installation):\\
\begin{lstlisting}
export FISOC_ISM="Elmer"
export FISOC_ISM_INC="-I$ELMER_HOME/share/elmersolver/include"
export FISOC_ISM_SO="$ELMER_HOME/lib/libelmersolver.so"      
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$ELMER_HOME/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"   
\end{lstlisting}

\label{sec:FISOC_SDG}


***configuration:
The configuration file is compatible with ESMF config methods.  
An ESMF\_config object is created and ESMF methods can be used to access config info.
There are some parameters that are derived from config parameters.  
The FISOC\_utils module provides subroutines (***names of these subroutines in table?) 
for obtaining derived config parameters.
These subroutines can be viewed informally as additional methods to complement the ESMF config access methods. 
Note that the hard-coded calculations to provide derived config parameters cause a loss of 
efficiency (except possibly in the case of intelligent optimisation from compilers) but these 
are very cheap operations and this does not have a measurable impact on the overall 
computational cost of the FISOC code.
*** make any additional config information to the model specific wrapper without needing further coding.
