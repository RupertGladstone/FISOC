Uses one of the userfunctions from Ex1 which must be copied and compiled:
cp ../Ex1_LongThinMIS/FISOC_Elmer_geometries.f90 .
elmerf90 FISOC_Elmer_geometries.f90 -o FISOC_Elmer_geometries.so

Grid creation is similar to Ex1 too, see also Ex1 README.

ElmerGrid 1 2 FISOC_Ex5.grd
ElmerGrid 2 2 FISOC_Ex5 -partition 1 2 0 2
ElmerGrid 2 2 FISOC_Ex5 -partition 1 24 0 2

Like in Ex1 you can also make a triangular element mesh for Ex5
using the .geo file and gmsh (edit lc in the geo file for element 
size):
gmsh FISOC_Ex5.geo -1 -2
ElmerGrid 14 2 FISOC_Ex5.msh 
Of course you need gmsh installed to do this.  Can be partitioned 
in the same way as the regular quad mesh.

There is also a .geo file for a refined (near the grounding line) mesh.
gmsh FISOC_Ex5_RM.geo -1 -2
Using metis might give a better partitioning in this case.
ElmerGrid 2 2 FISOC_Ex5_RM -metis 24 4
