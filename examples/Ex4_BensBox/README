Note that example 5 is a variant on example 4 and does not have its own README, instead being summarised here.

Uses one of the userfunctions from Ex1 which must be copied and compiled:
cp ../Ex1_LongThinMIS/FISOC_Elmer_geometries.f90 .
elmerf90 FISOC_Elmer_geometries.f90 -o FISOC_Elmer_geometries.so

Grid creation is similar to Ex1 too, see also Ex1 README.

To make the mesh:
ElmerGrid 1 2 FISOC_Ex4.grd

To partition the mesh for parallel runs (4 partitions):
ElmerGrid 2 2 FISOC_Ex4 -partition 1 4 0 2

Ex5 (like Ex4 but with grounded section):
cp ../Ex1_LongThinMIS/FISOC_Elmer_geometries.f90 .
elmerf90 FISOC_Elmer_geometries.f90 -o FISOC_Elmer_geometries.so
ElmerGrid 1 2 FISOC_Ex5.grd
ElmerGrid 2 2 FISOC_Ex5 -partition 1 2 0 2
ElmerGrid 2 2 FISOC_Ex5 -partition 1 4 0 2

Like in Ex1 you can also make a triangular element mesh for Ex5
using the .geo file and gmsh (edit lc in the geo file for element 
size):
gmsh FISOC_Ex5.geo -1 -2
ElmerGrid 14 2 FISOC_Ex5.msh 
Of course you need gmsh installed to do this.  Can be partitioned 
in the same way as the regular quad mesh.

TODO: read the info below in case any is useful, then delete.

Old TODO:

fix om hack to set 20m water column depth

draft:
change roms to not set any of draft, draft2 or zice during running.
change fisoc to first set old draft to draft2, then set draft2 and zice to the new cavity from ism.

implement corrected dddt

try much finer ism mesh

why does some ocean output text not get written to the specified text file?  (fort 31)

prevent ROMS and Elmer from calling mpi finalise

code tidy for finalise: make FISOC_Finalize, to finalize fisoc things before calling esmf_finalize.  Use this for all fatal calls (huge number of replacements required!)

replace the three line fatal (log pass through etc) with a single fatal routine

code tidy up:make coupler phases 1 and 2 more similar.  They should echo each other (ideally have some auto generated code here to avoid duplication, but that is probably overengineering...
