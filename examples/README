Summary of FISOC examples

Example 1.  Long thin Marine Ice Sheet.  To be run coupled with the ROMS 
iceshelf2d case.  To test the coupling in an almost flowline like mode, 
with no rotation in the ocean.  Same domain as the default FISh setup.


Setting up the domain (this should probably go into the manual) should be 
consistent between the ISM domain and the OM domain.  The domain is defined 
by the components in their normal way, not by FISOC.

In ROMS, the bathymmetry is represented by variable "h", which is typically 
defined (at least for simple idealised cases) in analytical.f90. 
Here is an example:

  h(i,j)=20.0_r8+REAL(j,r8)*(depth/Esize)*(Esize/REAL(Mm(ng),r8))


where Esize is domain length, depth is the maximum depth, and Mm is the 
number of internal grid points in the ETA direction (this is the same as 
the j direction I think).  So j/Mm is the fractional distance through the 
domain, and the above formula boils down to a linear 
bathymetry:

h = 20 + j(depth/Esize)(Esize/Mm)
h = 20 + depth*j/Mm

Note that this means the bathymetry exceeds the maximum depth, a 
contradiction in terms?



IF (j.le.60) THEN
  zice(i,j)=-h(i,j)+20_r8
zice = -h +20

ELSE
  zice(i,j)=-(h(i,60)-atan(REAL(j-59,r8)/10) * (h(i,60)-300_r8)) + 20_r8
zice = - h_60 - atan((j-59)/10) * (h_60-300) +20
     = - h_60 - h_60 * atan(***) -300 atan(***)
h_60 * (1-atan)

j==60 corresponds to x_dist = 60*(Esize / Mm)
dy = Esize / Mm

Bathymmetry in this context means the depth in metres of the upper 
surface of the solid earth (i.e. ocean floor or bedrock) below sea level, 
positive downwards.













Latest example (June 10th 2014) is in MISevolSetup4Elmer.  This contains 
setup for 3D simulations, hopefully fairly generic.

meshGen contains a python script used for various earlier mesh generation. 

Note that the flowline meshes created that way are still in use for the 
Budd (and Weertman) sliding stuff.

TODO:
Distil the essentials for the Budd flowline sliding stuff: mesh gen, 
sif template, grd file and merge into the newer MISevolSetup4Elmer 
directory... maybe need to read in geometry from file... merge with 
MISevolSetup4Elmer should help with that...

# stuff below is mostly out of date...

# FISOC/examples contains sample code used while developing FISOC.
# 
# Hopefully this README can be run as a script...
# 
# To create the longThinMIS (MIS means Marine Ice Sheet) example:
#
elmerf90 DummySolver.f90 -o DummySolver.so 
cd meshGen
python FISOC_mesh1a_prep.py

PYELA_merge.py PYELA_sp_template.sif PYELA_sp_constants.sif PYELA_sp_simulation.sif PYELA_sp_readBedrock.sif PYELA_sp_depthAndHeight.sif PYELA_sp_groundedMask.sif  PYELA_sp_marineFlowBCs.sif PYELA_sp_basicDynamics.sif PYELA_sp_2freeSurfaces.sif  PYELA_sp_Paraview.sif
mv PYELA_merged.sif  ../longThinMIS/mesh1a.sif 
cp -r FISOC_mesh1a_3D ../longThinMIS
cp ../DummySolver.so ../longThinMIS
cp -r FISOC_mesh1a_DEM  ../longThinMIS

#
# To then create the longThinMIS_periodic (i.e. with periodic boundary conditions for the sidewalls) example:
#
PYELA_merge.py PYELA_sp_template.sif PYELA_sp_constants.sif PYELA_sp_simulation.sif PYELA_sp_readBedrock.sif PYELA_sp_depthAndHeight.sif PYELA_sp_groundedMask.sif  PYELA_sp_marineFlowBCs_periodic.sif PYELA_sp_basicDynamics.sif PYELA_sp_2freeSurfaces.sif  PYELA_sp_Paraview.sif
mv PYELA_merged.sif ../longThinMIS_periodic/mesh1a_periodic.sif 
cp -r FISOC_mesh1a_3D ../longThinMIS_periodic
cp ../DummySolver.so ../longThinMIS_periodic
cp -r FISOC_mesh1a_DEM  ../longThinMIS_periodic

#
# These examples are for comparison against Elmer/Ice-only simulations run through the FISOC/ESMF 
# interface, to verify the interface. 
#
# FISOC_mesh1a_prep.py is a python script for generating simple meshes.  It uses numpy 
# to generate arrays for bedrock and surface ehight data, ElmerGrid for generation of 
# a simple rectangular 2d mesh, and ExtrudeMesh to extrude to a 3d mesh. 
#
# ElmerGrid and ExtrudeMesh both come with a recent (2013 or later) Elmer/Ice checkout. 
# Extrudemesh can be found under the Elmer/Ice section of the Elmer repository.
#
# Note from elmerice wiki (should we avoid periodic BCs?):
# 2013-03-07: GetHydrostaticloads has an issue for periodic boundary conditions: the force is half what it should be on the periodic boundary whereas the residual account for the fact that the domain is periodic. TODO: fix this!
