FISOC/examples contains sample code used while developing FISOC.

mesh1a.sif is an elmer sif file (solver input file) for simple standalone simulations.  
This is for comparison against Elmer/Ice-only simulations run through the FISOC/ESMF 
interface. 

FISOC_mesh1a_prep.py is a python script for generating simple meshes.  It uses numpy 
to generate arrays for bedrock and surface ehight data, ElmerGrid for generation of 
a simple rectangular 2d mesh, and ExtrudeMesh to extrude to a 3d mesh. 

ElmerGrid and ExtrudeMesh both come with a recent (2013 or later) Elmer/Ice checkout. 
Extrudemesh can be found under the Elmer/Ice section of the Elmer repository.


modify meshing and also cavity.sif to work with my grid...

***mesh: need seperate labels for:
1. back wall (flux in? of no flux and stick some accumulation on the surface?)
2. sides walls
3. ice front

***then edit sif file:
1. flux or no flux, no slip condition at back wall 
2. periodic free-slip b.c. for side walls
3. water pressure at ice front (maybe fix it first before we have agrounding line)
4. add grounding line stuff from wiki

sif filenames: mesh1ap2 is phase 2 of mesh1a.  Intention is to use difference between them to 
construct sif inputs to PYELA (reverse engineering...).  Also need to break up mesh1a into 
smaller components at some point for creation of PYELA inputs.

2013-03-07: GetHydrostaticloads has an issue for periodic boundary conditions: the force is half what it should be on the periodic boundary whereas the residual account for the fact that the domain is periodic. TODO: fix this!
