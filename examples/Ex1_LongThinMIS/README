Elmer/Ice example for coupling to ROMS through FISOC.  This is for a long thin idealised 
domain, rather fjord-like.


To make the mesh:
ElmerGrid 1 2 FISOC_Ex1.grd

To partition the mesh for parallel runs:
ElmerGrid 2 2 FISOC_Ex1 -partition 4 1 0 2


To compile the geometry functions:
elmerf90 FISOC_Elmer_geometries.f90 -o FISOC_Elmer_geometries.so

Make directories for outputs:
mkdir outputs
mkdir VTUoutputs


To run in stand alone mode:
ElmerSolver FISOC_Ex1.sif 

Or in parallel:
mpirun -np 4 ElmerSolver 


To clean this folder of output files:
rm -rf FISOC_Ex1/*result*
rm -rf VTUoutputs/*vtu



*** To run through FISOC ***

TODO: check any useful information here is represented also in the FISOC manual.

Add the full path of the .sif to the FISOC config file, for example:
  ISM_configFile:     /home/elmeruser/Source/FISOC/examples/Ex1_LongThinMIS/FISOC_Ex1.sif

Put the compiled user functions where Elmer can find them, for example:
cp FISOC_Elmer_geometries.so $ELMER_HOME/share/elmersolver/lib/

Provide in the .sif the full path to directories needed at run time, e.g.
...
Header
  Mesh DB "/home/elmeruser/Source/FISOC/examples/Ex1_LongThinMIS" "FISOC_Ex1"
End
...
  Output File = "/home/elmeruser/Source/FISOC/examples/Ex1_LongThinMIS/"$name".result"
...
  Procedure = File "ResultOutputSolve" "ResultOutputSolver"
  Output Directory = File "/home/elmeruser/Source/FISOC/examples/Ex1_LongThinMIS/VTUoutputs"
...
