Elmer/Ice example for coupling to ROMS through FISOC.  This is for a long thin idealised 
domain, rather fjord-like.


To make the mesh:
ElmerGrid 1 2 FISOC_Ex1.grd

To partition the mesh for parallel runs:
ElmerGrid 2 2 FISOC_Ex1 -partition 4 1 0 2


To compile the geometry functions:
elmerf90 FISOC_Elmer_geometries.f90 -o FISOC_Elmer_geometries.so


Make directories for outputs:
mkdir outputs
mkdir VTUoutputs


To run in stand alone mode:
ElmerSolver FISOC_Ex1.sif 

Or in parallel:
mpirun -np 4 ElmerSolver 

To run through FISOC:
***
