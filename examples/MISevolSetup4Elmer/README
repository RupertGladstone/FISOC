# Summary of steps for creating input files for some idealised Elmer/Ice 
# simulations of marine ice sheets.

#To create the mesh:

# create 2d grid
ElmerGrid 1 2 longThinMIS.grd

# convert to elmer post format to check grid
ElmerGrid 2 3 longThinMIS

# partition 2D grid into 16 or 32 partitions
ElmerGrid 2 2 longThinMIS -metis 16 4
ElmerGrid 2 2 longThinMIS -metis 32 4

# These steps have created a 2d mesh but with no information about 
# upper and lower ice surfaces or about bedrock elevations.


# Create DEMs to be "included" in the sif files.  This script creates ascii 
# DEM files for upper and lower surfaces and bedrock elevations.  These 
# files will be read by Elmer/Ice at the start of a simulation.
./makeSimpleDEM.py

# If using real world data you probably will need to process your data 
# (from netcdf for example) into this same ascii format as the above script.

# Once mesh and DEM files are ready, you need a solver input file.  The 
# example file here (longThinMIS.sif) has had a couple of changes made 
# corresponding to the DEM (made by the above makeSimpleDEM.py script from 
# the longThinMIS.sif.template file).
#
# Note that the  longThinMIS_meshOnly.sif file should also have been created. 
# Running Elmer/Ice with this input file should result in the mesh being processed 
# (extruded from 2d and mapped according to the upper and lower surfaces defined 
# in the DEM files) but no further calculations.  It is basically a copy of the standard 
# sif but with only one timestep and the more costly solvers (especially the Stokes 
# solver) turned off.
#
# The meshOnly simulation is useful because it should help to verify that 
# 1. the DEM information has been corectly prescribed
# 2. the boundary condition labelling is correct
#
# An example batch submit script is also provided here, as used on the Australian 
# NCI HPC resource Raijin.
#
# When you are ready to run, tar up all the files you need to run Elmer/Ice 
# and copy them to the machine of your choice...
tar -cf meshFiles.tar batchSubmit.sh ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO longThinMIS_meshOnly.sif longThinMIS.sif longThinMIS_restart.sif longThinMIS_DEM longThinMIS
#scp  meshFiles.tar rmg581@raijin.nci.org.au:/short/m68/rmg581/elmerIce/longThinMIS

# TODO: at a later date: extend this example setup to cover real world domains
# (should include script for converting upper and lower surfaces from netcdf files)

# TODO: add auto creation of a restart sif to python script...
# solvers to read in bedrock should be removed, restart file should be named at top of sif.
# care with initialisation: which vars to be read in from restart, any to be initialised in sif? 
# in particular check structured mesh mapper and free surface solvers
